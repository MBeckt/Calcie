good to know how to make it work though.-->

StyleSheet1.scss is the main item for editing most of the css, StyleSheet2.scss is the overflow mess of the first and .css will likely not be pretty at this point.

StyleSheet1.css is the easiest to work from in visual, limited syntax help for Sass :(

jQuery... added a button for a toggle effect on a element.
